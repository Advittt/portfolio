      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>After I graduated in July 2024, I also got my Green Card in October 2024. This 17 year long process came to me at the perfect time. I moved to so-Cal on my 22nd Birthday to puruse a career in the tech industry.</p>
      <p>Computer science bridges creativity and academics. From classroom studies to building websites, or from solving basic problems to predicting future outcomes - coding is, for me, a phenomenal experience. It allows for the amalgamation of ideas with indispensable mathematics, and this fascinates me greatly. Unlike any other subject, deriving the solution to a problem using an AI/ML based approach feels highly rewarding to me, and it comes as a result of hard work and patience.</p>
      <p>I have always been an advocate of AI, I was a mentor for 2 years and the AI/ML co-lead for the Google Developer Student Club (hosted by Google). Taking machine learning and data science courses has equipped me with the theoretical and practical skills to analyse large data sets. I have also worked on projects that have demonstrated my ability to apply statistical skills, such as developing and optimizing predictive models, which have transferable skills. My enthusiasm, having learned various languages such as Python and Java fuels my conviction that joining a company with integrity will create a symbiotic environment for continuous growth and development. </p>
      <p>Overall, I am eager to be adopting the right technologies to progress in the evolving AI era. I am most excited to learn more about the cutting-edge software behind companies and study new methodologies that leverage my passion in machine learning to drive a meaningful impact. To be a part of a culture of openness, transparency and accountability, bouncing ideas from one another resulting in greatness; a culture of professional superhumans! </p>
      <p>Skills: Python, Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Data Analysis, ML Optimization, Software Engineering, Java</p>
      <p>Education: 2:1 in a Bachalors of Science with Honors in Computer Science / The University of Manchester</p>
      <p>Interests: AI Research, Robotics, Startups, Technology Innovation, Software Engineering</p>
